# Algorithms Illuminated
All algorithms described in Algorithms Illuminated book [(Omnibus Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Omnibus-Tim-Roughgarden/dp/0999282980/ref=sr_1_1?crid=F9B1Q9YQORFV&keywords=algorithms+illuminated+omnibus+edition&qid=1697913986&sprefix=algorithms+illu%2Caps%2C822&sr=8-1).

Currently, I'm reading this book by **Prof. Tim Roughgarden** simultaneously with his **Algorithms
Specialization** on [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

I'll try to implement every algorithm mentioned in the book. This is done just for fun and to 
see how the pseudocode actually differ then a real programming language and how it is useful to 
translate a pseudocode to running program.

I'd like to receive any feedbacks or comments you have.
